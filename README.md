# Blockudoku++
This is a very basic copy of the Blockudoku mobile game ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybrain.block.puzzle.games&hl=en&gl=US), [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockudoku-block-puzzle-game/id1452227871)) written in C++ using SFML.

# Precompiled binaries
Check the [releases](https://github.com/CosminPerRam/Blockudokuplusplus/releases) page.  
Although precompiled binaries are only available for Windows, the code is cross platform.
